        <div class="subheading mb-5">English Major üìì‚úèÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Brittany Danielle Marie Coccia. I am an aspiring writer, animal enthusiast, and photographer. Currently, I am working on my English degree. In addition, I have started to learn how to program. My specialties include proofreading, customer service, personal communication, and quick-thinking problem solutions. I have 3 years experience volunteering with cats. Mainly my volunteer work in that area consists of socializing, grooming, and maintaining social media accounts.<br><br>

        Here is a sample of my creative writing:<br><br>

        <p dir="ltr"><span>So far away from any city, the stars were so visible. They glistened with possibilities and stories from long before I was born. I wondered if Ivy looked out at the stars like this. If she ever snuck out of the dorms with a friend and a blanket and just stared.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"Any new discoveries?" Lily asked, her voice slightly off from staring directly up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I sat up for a moment to reach for the notebook. My hands itching to thumb through it and explore through the cover of night. It would be so much easier with mrs Thurnsburry not breathing down my neck. Instead, I took a deep breath and adjusted the blanket under me so that the ruffles of the fabric supported my neck a bit better. "Not really," I sighed.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The rustle of fabric gave away her movements and her voice was clearer in my ear. I could feel the warmth of her breath as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"Thanks for taking the night off. All the sneaking around and the tests, I needed a night off."</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>My shoulders bounced as I chuckled, undoing my hard work but I could picture the sparkle of Lily's smile. It was going to be my undoing. At least when the stars sparkled, they were too far away and too far in the past to hurt me in the now. The past couldn't hurt me. I was in control.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"But we snuck out to star gaze," I turned to face her. A total mistake. Her eyes were inches away and any other words dissipated in my mouth like cotton candy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She only smirked and I watched the stars through her eyes. Overhead the distant makers of maps stayed firmly in the sky. The lights reflected off of the green in her eyes and a few strands of the dark, wavy body of her hair swayed with the motion of her breaths. Any closter our exhales would intertwine. Tangle together and swirl before spreading out over the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"Tonight was different." She suddenly said. "When go exploring, it isn't just the two of us. Ivy is there too."</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At that, I sat up and stared at her nose. &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lily sat up and brushed her pajama bottoms. &ldquo;You are always looking at that book, searching for traces of this mysterious student that nobody has even heard of. It&rsquo;s like I am getting third-wheeled by a ghost!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>My brain and mouth shut down. What did that mean? I searched my memories for what could have given her that impression.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Ever since I dragged her into that corridor, we had been inseparable. I started bringing her with me during breaks and she helped me follow leads from Ivy's journal. With who her mom was, she knew better than me what some areas described were. Tunnels littered with cobwebs, bookshelves that lead to empty rooms, even a way to reach the top of the lighthouse without using the janitor's keys. It was a wild ride I never wanted to stop. This was what was keeping me here. I thought she felt the same.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Didn't she have fun going on these escapades, too? Didn't her heart race that time we were almost caught? When she recognized the serrated leaf carved into the frame of a portrait. Her hands had been cold and clammy when she grabbed the sleeve of my uniform and pulled me into the opening. Our hearts must have been echoing in the tiny space. My mouth had been dry and the closed space made our body heat double. </span></p>
